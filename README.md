# killdeer

The Killdeer symbolizes resilience, adaptability, and steady growth â€” traits we believe are essential for successful farm management. Like the bird, this system is built to thrive across changing landscapes while staying deeply connected to the land.

This repository maintains code for managing localline and square connections, member subscriptions, as well as inventory management.
